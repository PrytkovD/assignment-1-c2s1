Stuff that took an eternity to code so I could spend less time coding this:
- Steaming pile of hot garbage cosplaying as an [injection framework](https://github.com/PrytkovD/inject).
- Amazingly featureless & unportable [PostgreSQL code generator/fluent interface over JDBC](https://github.com/PrytkovD/inject).

Thoroughly tested using lots of `System.out.println()`. Kinda works. Maybe doesn't. Whatever...
